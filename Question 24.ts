Question 25: 
Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Assign 'green', 'yellow', or 'red' to a variable called alien_color.
Explain & TIP: 
Use an if statement to check the alien's color. This introduces you to simple conditionals.

}

alien_color = "red";
if (alien_color == "green") {
    // No output because the condition is false
}
